## 🚀 About Me

I’m a DevOps Engineer and Pipeline Technical Director with over 6 years of experience designing scalable infrastructure, automating CI/CD workflows, and building monitoring systems that support both technical and creative teams.

I began my career in animation and VFX, where I worked closely with render farms, asset pipelines, and large-scale productions at studios like Blizzard, DNEG, and Boulder Media. In these roles, I adopted DevOps tools early — automating complex processes, managing distributed systems, and building robust tools in Python and Bash to support artists and engineers alike.

Most recently, I contributed to secure, cloud-native platforms at Smartmatic-Cybernetica and helped build out production workflows and infrastructure automation at SG Production OÜ.

My current stack includes AWS, Terraform, Prometheus, GitHub Actions, and Docker — and I'm passionate about bridging infrastructure and creative tooling, bringing clarity and stability to fast-moving environments.

I’m open to DevOps, infrastructure, and pipeline engineering roles — where I can continue solving problems at scale, empowering teams through automation and thoughtful tooling.
