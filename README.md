## 🚀 About Me



I'm a DevOps Engineer and Pipeline Technical Director with 6+ years of experience automating workflows, building infrastructure, and developing tools that support both engineering and creative teams.

My career began in the animation and VFX industry, where I worked as a Render Wrangler and Pipeline TD on major productions at studios like Blizzard, DNEG, and Disney. In these roles, I relied heavily on DevOps tools to solve production problems — automating asset publishing, managing render infrastructure, and building CI-like validation systems using Python, Git, ShotGrid, and Docker.

Over time, I leaned more into infrastructure, monitoring, and automation — leading to a natural transition into full-time DevOps work. At Smartmatic-Cybernetica, I contributed to secure, cloud-native systems using AWS, Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Prometheus, bringing that same production mindset into infrastructure at scale.

Today, I specialize in:

Building reproducible CI/CD systems

Creating developer tooling for faster feedback

Designing pipeline architectures that scale across teams

I thrive in roles where creativity meets infrastructure, where well-designed systems empower teams to do their best work — whether they’re artists or engineers.
