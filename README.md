## ✨ About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer and Pipeline Technical Director with over 6 years of experience building scalable infrastructure, automating creative and technical workflows, and bridging the gap between engineering and production.

My career began in the animation and VFX industry, where I developed tools and automated pipelines at studios like **Blizzard**, **DNEG**, and **Disney**. Working as a Render Wrangler and Pipeline TD, I gained hands-on experience with systems thinking, scripting, and infrastructure support — long before my role formally transitioned into DevOps.

Today, I specialize in:
- Automating CI/CD pipelines with **GitLab CI**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Docker**
- Deploying infrastructure and managing environments with **Ansible**, **AWS**, and **Linux**
- Designing observability stacks with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**
- Building structured, scalable pipelines that serve both engineering and creative teams

I bring a creative, systems-oriented mindset to every project, and I thrive in environments where well-designed infrastructure empowers teams to move faster, collaborate better, and ship with confidence.
